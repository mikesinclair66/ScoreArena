Score Arena is a single/multi player score-based game where the player seeks to eliminate the opponent's
score in order to win. When in game, the player is assigned three powers of choice that they can use
to benefit themselves or damage their opponent. The current powers available are:

-Attack (Depletes the opponent's score on contact)
-Absorb (Depletes the opponent's score while gaining score for the player on contact)
-Missiles (The player can shoot missiles at the opponent to deplete the opponent's score)
-Freeze (The opponent cannot move for a certain amount of time)
-Shield (The player cannot be damaged or hindered by any attack for a certain amount of time)
-Speed (The player's speed increases for a certain amount of time)

Score Arena currently has three maps. The first map is standard and without obstacles, while the other two
have obstacles that can either benefit the player or put them at a disadvantage.
